# App_MyCollection2023

This is personal application, that was designed to keep track on collections. The designer, me, have collected physical movies, series and music for so long, that it's a real challenge to remember them all. So to prevent buying multiple copies, I created this app.

The app is designed to be simple and easy to use. It's not meant to be a full scale movie database, but a tool to keep track on your own collection. The app is not meant to be used for commercial purposes.

All the data in the app is stored locally on the device. The app is using TMDB-database to get information about movies. It doesn't collect any personal information from the user, use cookies or other tracking methods. The app is created with React Native and Expo. The source code is available in GitHub.
